        <h3 class="skillName"> Photoshop </h3>
        <p class="summary"> <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows.</p>
        <p class="summary"> <strong>Photoshop</strong> was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, it has become the de facto industry standard in raster graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a verb as in "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though Adobe discourages such use.</p>
