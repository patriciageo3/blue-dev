 
## Synopsis

This is a website whose purpose is to present and practice web design skills.

It was created with the help of:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP

## Installation

No installation is needed. The package has everything it needs.

The website needs to be run on a server, though.

## Motivation

While creating this website, the main focus was on functionality, rather than actual design, as one might consider the look as being a little too rough for today`s world.
The retro look was combined with functionality capabilities, implemented with the help of JavaScript.

## Functionality

All menus and information on the website are created dinamically with PHP (including the headers and footers).

The **Browse Developers page** offers an advanced search engine, letting the user search the "database" for the developers with certain skills coming from a city of interest (the "City" field being optional).

Skills can be inputed in any format (separated by only spaces, only commas, commas and spaces, slashes, and so on). The engine automatically cleans them up and outputs only the developers who meet the valid criteria.

The **Newsletter section** lets the user input his/ her name and address and then shows a confirmation message for subscription and a "welcome" message each time the user logs in. It also offers the possibility of unsubscription at the click of a button.

The left navigation menu also permits the users to get the database filtered at a click of a button, by the developer skill they may need.
