        <h3 class="skillName"> SEO </h3>
        <p class="summary"> <strong>Search engine optimization (SEO) </strong> is the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid resultsâ€”often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a website appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national or international searches.</p>
